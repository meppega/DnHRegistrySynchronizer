    #    more details).
    #  - The tags being synced for a mapping can be limited by providing a 'tags'
    #    list. This list may contain semver and regular expressions filters
    #    (see below). When omitted, all image tags are synced.
    #  - With 'platform', the image to sync from a multi-platform source image
    #    can be selected (see below).
